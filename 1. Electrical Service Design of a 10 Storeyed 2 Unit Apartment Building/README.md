The Electrical Service Design Project focused on creating a comprehensive electrical layout for a multi-story residential building, involving key tasks like room-by-room fixture placement, conduit layout, switchboard connections, and power distribution systems. The design included calculating the number of lights and fans for each room based on illumination and power requirements, designing the electrical flow through the building, and ensuring safety with circuit breakers and a lightning protection system. The project also involved calculating transformer, generator, and power factor improvement (PFI) ratings, with a focus on ensuring safe and efficient electrical distribution. Additionally, the system incorporated both emergency and standard power circuits. This project provided hands-on experience in residential electrical design, focusing on practical application of electrical codes and safety standards.
